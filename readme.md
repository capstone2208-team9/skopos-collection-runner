# Collection Runner for Skopos
The collection runner is a component of Skopos that is responsible for executing multi-step tests. It uses Xstate as a state machine to orchestrate multi-step testing. The collection runner:
- Fetches data necessary for running the tests from a graphql server.
- Executes the tests using a state machine (Xstate).
- If any error occurs, it sends a notification using SNS (Simple Notification Service).
- Finally, it sends the tests data to the graphql server.
